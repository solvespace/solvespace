Installation
------------

### Via official binary packages

_Official_ release binary packages for macOS (>=10.6 64-bit) and Windows (>=Vista 32-bit) are
available via [GitHub releases][rel]. These packages are automatically built by
the SolveSpace maintainers for each stable release.

[rel]: https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace/releases

### Via third-party binary packages

_Third-party_ nightly binary packages for Debian and Ubuntu are available
via [notesalexp.org][notesalexp]. These packages are automatically built from non-released
source code. The SolveSpace maintainers do not control the contents of these packages
and cannot guarantee their functionality.

### Via source code

See below.

Building on Linux
-----------------

### Building for Linux

You will need the usual build tools, CMake, zlib, libpng, cairo, freetype.
To build the GUI, you will need fontconfig, gtkmm 3.0 (version 3.16 or later), pangomm 1.4,
OpenGL and OpenGL GLU, and optionally, the Space Navigator client library.
On a Debian derivative (e.g. Ubuntu) these can be installed with:

    sudo apt install git build-essential cmake zlib1g-dev libpng-dev \
                     libcairo2-dev libfreetype6-dev libjson-c-dev \
                     libfontconfig1-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev libpangomm-1.4-dev \
                     libgl-dev libglu-dev libspnav-dev

On a Redhat derivative (e.g. Fedora) the dependencies can be installed with:

    sudo dnf install git gcc-c++ cmake zlib-devel libpng-devel \
                     cairo-devel freetype-devel json-c-devel \
                     fontconfig-devel gtkmm30-devel pangomm-devel \
                     mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel libspnav-devel

Before building, check out the project and the necessary submodules:

    git clone https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace
    cd solvespace
    git submodule update --init extlib/libdxfrw extlib/flatbuffers extlib/q3d

After that, build SolveSpace as following:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make
    sudo make install

The graphical interface is built as `build/bin/solvespace`, and the command-line interface
is built as `build/bin/solvespace-cli`. It is possible to build only the command-line interface
by passing the `-DENABLE_GUI=OFF` flag to the cmake invocation.

### Building for Windows

You will need the usual build tools, CMake and a Windows cross-compiler.
On a Debian derivative (e.g. Ubuntu) these can be installed with:

    apt-get install git build-essential cmake mingw-w64

Before building, check out the project and the necessary submodules:

    git clone https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace
    cd solvespace
    git submodule update --init

After that, build 32-bit SolveSpace as following:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/Toolchain-mingw32.cmake \
             -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make

Or, build 64-bit SolveSpace as following:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/Toolchain-mingw64.cmake \
             -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make

The graphical interface is built as `build/bin/solvespace.exe`, and the command-line interface
is built as `build/bin/solvespace-cli.exe`.

Space Navigator support will not be available.

If using Ubuntu to cross-compile, Ubuntu 17.10 or newer (or, alternatively, MinGW from the Ubuntu
17.10 repositories) is required.

Building on macOS
-----------------

You will need git, XCode tools and CMake. Git and CMake can be installed
via [Homebrew][]:

    brew install git cmake

XCode has to be installed via AppStore or [the Apple website][appledeveloper];
it requires a free Apple ID.

Before building, check out the project and the necessary submodules:

    git clone https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace
    cd solvespace
    git submodule update --init

After that, build SolveSpace as following:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make

Alternatively, generate an XCode project, open it, and build the "Release" scheme:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -G Xcode

The application is built in `build/bin/SolveSpace.app`, the graphical interface executable
is `build/bin/SolveSpace.app/Contents/MacOS/SolveSpace`, and the command-line interface executable
is `build/bin/SolveSpace.app/Contents/MacOS/solvespace-cli`.

Building on OpenBSD
-------------------

You will need git, cmake, libexecinfo, libpng, gtk3mm and pangomm.
These can be installed from the ports tree:

    pkg_add -U git cmake libexecinfo png json-c gtk3mm pangomm

Before building, check out the project and the necessary submodules:

    git clone https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace
    cd solvespace
    git submodule update --init extlib/libdxfrw extlib/flatbuffers extlib/q3do

After that, build SolveSpace as following:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make

Unfortunately, on OpenBSD, the produced executables are not filesystem location independent
and must be installed before use. By default, the graphical interface is installed to
`/usr/local/bin/solvespace`, and the command-line interface is built as
`/usr/local/bin/solvespace-cli`. It is possible to build only the command-line interface
by passing the `-DENABLE_GUI=OFF` flag to the cmake invocation.

Building on Windows
-------------------

You will need [git][gitwin], [cmake][cmakewin] and Visual C++.

### Building with Visual Studio IDE

Check out the git submodules. Create a directory `build` in
the source tree and point cmake-gui to the source tree and that directory.
Press "Configure" and "Generate", then open `build\solvespace.sln` with
Visual C++ and build it.

### Building with Visual Studio in a command prompt

First, ensure that git and cl (the Visual C++ compiler driver) are in your
`%PATH%`; the latter is usually done by invoking `vcvarsall.bat` from your
Visual Studio install. Then, run the following in cmd or PowerShell:

    git clone https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace
    cd solvespace
    git submodule update --init
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    nmake

### Building with MinGW

It is also possible to build SolveSpace using [MinGW][mingw], though
Space Navigator support will be disabled.

First, ensure that git and gcc are in your `$PATH`. Then, run the following
in bash:

    git clone https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace
    cd solvespace
    git submodule update --init
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make
