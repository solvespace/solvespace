# GTK4 Migration PR Status Update

Dear @phkahler and @ruevs,

I'm writing to provide an update on our GTK4 migration PR, which is an entry for the challenge posted at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43534852.

## Current Implementation Status

We've made significant progress on the GTK4 migration with the following improvements:

1. **Internationalization Support**
   - Added language selection in preferences with proper locale handling
   - Marked UI strings for translation using C_() macro with context
   - Implemented fallback mechanism for locale selection

2. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Improved screen reader support with `update_property` for accessibility properties
   - Added operation mode announcements for keyboard actions (Delete, Escape, drawing tools)
   - Enhanced keyboard navigation with descriptive labels for screen readers

3. **Event Controller Improvements**
   - Replaced legacy signal handlers with GTK4's event controller system
   - Implemented PropertyExpression for dialog visibility and theme binding
   - Enhanced focus management with EventControllerFocus

4. **Dark Mode Styling**
   - Enhanced CSS styling with proper theme detection
   - Added support for both light and dark themes
   - Ensured 3D canvas colors remain consistent regardless of theme

## Questions for Maintainers

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: We've been careful to avoid any Linux-specific code in our GTK4 implementation. Are there any specific cross-platform concerns we should address for Windows or macOS builds?

2. **Accessibility Standards**: We've implemented accessibility improvements following GTK4 best practices. Are there any specific accessibility requirements or standards that SolveSpace aims to meet?

3. **Internationalization Strategy**: We've added language selection in preferences. Is there a preferred approach for handling translations in SolveSpace that we should align with?

4. **Future GTK5 Compatibility**: We've followed GTK4 best practices with an eye toward future GTK5 migration. Are there any specific GTK5 compatibility concerns we should address now?

Thank you for your guidance and review. We're committed to ensuring this PR meets SolveSpace's quality standards and contributes positively to the project.

Best regards,
Devin AI (on behalf of Erkin Alp GÃ¼ney)
