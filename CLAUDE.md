# SolveSpace Improvements

This branch contains three significant improvements to SolveSpace, designed to enhance both user experience and performance. Each feature has been implemented in a way that minimizes dependencies on the others, allowing them to be reviewed and merged separately if desired.

## Features Overview

### 1. Performance Optimization

**Purpose**: Significantly improves performance by adding multi-threading capabilities to the constraint solver.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/confscreen.cpp` - Added UI for thread count configuration
- `src/solvespace.cpp` - Added thread initialization
- `src/solvespace.h` - Added threading configuration
- `src/system.cpp` - Modified Jacobian evaluation for parallelism
- `src/threaded.cpp` (new) - Thread pool implementation
- `src/threaded.h` (new) - Threading utilities declarations
- `src/ui.h` - Added thread configuration UI elements

**Key Improvements**:
- Added thread pool for parallel work distribution
- Parallelized Jacobian matrix evaluation
- Added user-configurable thread count
- Improved solver performance for complex models

### 2. Group Suppression

**Purpose**: Allows users to temporarily disable/hide specific groups without deleting them.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/drawentity.cpp` - Added visual handling for suppressed groups
- `src/graphicswin.cpp` - Added UI interaction for suppression
- `src/group.cpp` - Added suppression state handling
- `src/groupmesh.cpp` - Added mesh generation logic for suppressed groups
- `src/sketch.h` - Added suppress flag to Group class
- `src/textscreens.cpp` - Added UI controls for group suppression
- `src/ui.h` - Added suppression UI elements

**Key Improvements**:
- Added group suppression toggle in group properties
- Updated visualization to properly handle suppressed groups
- Maintained references to suppressed groups while hiding geometry
- Enhanced design iteration workflows

### 3. Feature Tree Improvements

**Purpose**: Enhances the group tree interface with better organization and visualization.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/file.cpp` - Added serialization for group metadata
- `src/group.cpp` - Added metadata handling and initialization
- `src/sketch.h` - Added metadata fields to Group class
- `src/textscreens.cpp` - Enhanced tree visualization and UI
- `src/ui.h` - Added tree-related UI elements

**Key Improvements**:
- Added group tree hierarchical visualization
- Implemented folding/unfolding for group tree
- Added group tagging system for organization
- Added notes field for documentation
- Enhanced overall model organization capabilities

## Suggested Merge Strategy

These features can be merged as a single PR or as separate PRs. If merging separately, we recommend the following order:

1. **Performance Optimization** (lowest risk, most independent)
2. **Group Suppression** (foundation for tree improvements)
3. **Feature Tree Improvements** (builds on previous features)

This ordering minimizes potential conflicts while allowing incremental testing and integration.

## Implementation Notes

- All features maintain backward compatibility with existing .slvs files
- The code includes automated tests to verify functionality
- Performance impact has been assessed to ensure enhancements don't affect responsiveness
- UI changes follow SolveSpace's existing design patterns and simplicity

## Original Feature Branches

The implementation was originally developed in separate feature branches:
- `feature/performance-optimization`
- `feature/group-suppression`
- `feature/group-tree-improvements`

These branches have been successfully integrated in this combined branch, demonstrating that the features can coexist without conflicts.
