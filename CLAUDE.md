# Feature Tree Improvements Implementation

This document tracks the implementation progress for the Feature Tree Improvements in SolveSpace.

## Phase 1: Group Tree Restructuring

### Tasks Completed
- Added metadata fields to the Group class:
  - folded (boolean): track folded/expanded state in tree view
  - tags (string array): user-defined organizational tags
  - notes (string): user annotations for documentation
  - customIcon (string): user-selected icon for visual identification
- Implemented serialization/deserialization for new metadata
- Added backward compatibility handling for older file versions
- Enhanced text window display to show hierarchical relationships between groups
- Implemented indentation based on dependency level
- Added visual indicators for group folding state
- Implemented toggle controls for expanding/collapsing subgroups
- Added UI for editing group notes and tags

### Next Steps
- Add search/filter functionality for groups based on tags
- Implement "expand all" and "collapse all" functionality
- Enhance dependency visualization between groups
- Add custom icon support for groups
- Implement drag-and-drop reordering of compatible operations

### Implementation Notes
- The implementation leverages existing opA relationships to determine the group hierarchy
- The folded state is persisted to file, allowing users to maintain their preferred tree organization
- Tags are stored as a vector of strings and serialized with semicolon delimiters
- The UI has been updated to show indent levels based on the dependency depth
- Fold/unfold controls only appear for groups that have children
