Some notes about Entities, Entity IDs and the IdList structure
==============================================================
Sketch entities in SolveSpace are all of the same type without use of language
support for polymorphism. The entity class is defined in sketch.h. That class
contains an enum for each entity to define its type (line, arc, etc...) and some
other members that can be used to store different things depending on the entity
type. This means all entities are the same size, so some data may be reference
by pointers from the entity (font, extra points, etc...)

Entities in a sketch are kept in a global array (IdList) referenced by a unique
Id (handle) and can be looked up by Id in log(n) time via binary search. In
order to use binary search the array must be kept in order sorted by Id. One
problem is that insertion takes O(n) time because half the list (on average)
must be shifted to make room for a new item.

The IdList class is a template and is used for more than entities.

EntityMap:
==========
Another important structure is the EntityMap and EntityKey defined in sketch.h
This is what allows SovleSpace to update groups when earlier groups in the
sketch are changed. If a rectangle is extruded to a box and items are
constrained to entities on that box, the user can go back to the sketch and
modify it. Entities can be added, modified an even deleted. So long as the
entities that are later used to build upon are kept the later extrude group will
pick up the changes from the 2D sketch and anything build on it will remain.

The way this works is that each group has a member called remap, which is one of
these maps. This is where my understanding is fuzzy. At the end of Group.cpp is
a function called Group::CopyEntity() which is used to make new sketch entities
when a group is created. These are generally copies of entities in the previous
group, but there are exceptions. A point will be used to generate a line when
extruding a 2D sketch. A point will also be "copied" to a circle for a Lathe
group. For this reason, the entity key is derived by combining its previous key
with something often called the CopyNumber or just remap (unfortunate).

When a group is regenerated (the first time, or after a previous one is
modified) entities are copied from the old group to the new one. For Step
Translating and Rotating there may be many copies, and the copy number is
literally N for the Nth copy except for the last one which gets an enum - it is
common to constrain the last item, so it gets a large unique number so that
constraints still refer to it if the number of copies changes. When an entity is
copied like this a new handle is created unless there is already an entity in
Remap that was created the same way. This is how constructions are preserved
across underlying changes.

There are some hard limits used in the hash table for the remap mechanism which
limit the number of entities in a group (but not the global sketch).
